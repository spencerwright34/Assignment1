    <p>We have spent time in other classes learning front end development and I am excited to spend time learning more about the back end development. I don't know a lot about what enterprise application development is but I am excited to expand my programming knowledge and see how I can use this in my professional career. I find programming difficult, but very interesting. I hope I can increase my skills and knowledge in this field from this class because I would like to pursue something in development in my career.</p>
